* The stranger tells you that if you can guess the value of the total crystals he has in his bag, he will let you keep them all.
* He gives you 4 crytals to pick from. Each crystal containing it's own value.
* If you can get the value of your crystals to match the value of the crystals he has in his bag, you get to keep them all.
* Each crystal's value will vary by size an cut
* So be carefull, everytime you pick a crystal the value added to your score will be random.
* Stop at will, go over and you loose !
